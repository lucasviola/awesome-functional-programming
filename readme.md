### Blog posts
- [Personal thoughts on the current functional programming bandwagon](http://www.akitaonrails.com/2015/10/28/personal-thoughts-on-the-current-functional-programming-bandwagon) - Despite the name, this post actually clarifies some baisc concepts on Functional Programming, explains some of the History of FP and the implementation of FPs features on imperative languages and talks about all the fuss on declarative programming and why it has become so popular in the last few years.

### Papers

### Wikis
- [nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) - A wiki-lab with articles, discussion and tools from the point of view of category theory, which is the main math behind FP.

### Books
- [The Little Prover](https://books.google.com.br/books?id=I9E_CgAAQBAJ&pg=PR13#v=onepage&q&f=false) - Talks about
a theorem prover called JBob for writing proofs in LISP.

### Communities
- [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) - Community focused on discussing researches, papers
and hot topic on academia. Very high tech discussion level.
- [FP Complete](https://www.fpcomplete.com/) - Community focused on helping companies and students on learning and implementing Functional Programming in Haskell. Hosters of one of the most famous Haskell learning centers: [School of Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school)
