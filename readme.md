## Awesome Functional Programming [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Based on the [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/) project

## What is this about?

On the last decade, functional programming has gained a new found power due to its
declarative characteristics which, some would say, are very effective for parallel computing
and for the whole usage of [Moores Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law).

This repo gathers some material on Functional Programming such as blog posts, papers, videos,
tools, etc. and also aims to clarify some of the theoretical subjects behind it.
